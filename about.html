            <h2><img src="DALL·E-2023-12-16 02.20.38-Flag-of-Jamaica.png" alt="Jamaica Flag">Our History</h2>
            <p>
                <span>Our forefathers arrived in Jamaica on 04 August 1755. They bought property at Donolva District,Hanover, had children then bequathed the land to them and this gave birth to Excell Water Works. Excell Water Works is now at the
                forefront of environmentally friendly water treatment solutions. Our innovative approach to water purification using activated bamboo charcoal has set new standards in the industry</span>
                <br>
                <br> 1n 1838 Edward Samuels walked away from the plantation in westmoreland behind his fathers horse to a 40 acre property in the hills of Donalva District in hanover that was called "barrel". The next generation consisting of 9 sons and
                a daughter, prospered through the farming of yams and other ground provisions and the property grew to 240 acres before a near trajedy stopped the trajectory and the holding was reduced to 140 acres. The 3rd generation continued the yam
                farming but the fourth generation migrated to other lands and other trades. However the species of Bambusa vulgaris used to stick the yams covered the land and when the family returned there was an obvious need to find some useful way
                to deal with the preponderance of bamboo on the land. This was the motivation of the research which led to the development of Charboo acivated bamboo charcoal.
