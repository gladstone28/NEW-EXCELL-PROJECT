            <h2><img src="DALL·E-2023-12-16 02.20.38-Flag-of-Jamaica.png" alt="Jamaica Flag">Our History</h2>
            <p>
                <span>In 1838, Edward Samuels walked away from the plantation in Westmoreland, following his father's horse to a 40-acre property in the hills of the Donalva District in Hanover, known as "Barrel"</span>.
                <br>
                <br> The subsequent generation, comprising nine sons and a daughter, thrived through yam and ground provision farming, expanding the property to 240 acres. However, a near tragedy altered the course, reducing the holding to 140 acres.
                The third generation sustained yam farming, but the fourth generation migrated to different lands and trades. Upon their return, the land was overrun with Bambusa vulgaris previously used as yam sticks for yam support, highligting the
                need to address the bamboo proliferation with urgency.
                <br>
                <br> In 2019, Donald Excell visited the Bureau of Standards(BSJ), engaging in a discussion with Mr. Gladstone Rose, then the Director of Special Projects, about bamboo's uses, particularly in producing bamboo charcoal as a tree-friendly
                alternative for protecting the environment. During the meeting, Mr. Rose proposed focusing on non-chemical methods for activated bamboo charcoal production.
                <br>
                <br> The family conducted persistent research, leading to the production of BBQ Charcoal, later named and branded as "More Fire" bamboo charcoal because of its unique properties. By December 2023, the family achieving successful activation
                of bamboo charcoal verified by Laboratory analyses after submitting samples to the BSJ on two prior occasions. The activated bamboo charcoal was named "Charboo" and the process called "Excell Works" in honor of the family's main researcher,
                Donald Excell.
